            Mahatma Gandhi, whose full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India.
            He was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. Gandhi is best known for his
            philosophy of non-violence, or "Ahimsa," and civil disobedience. He inspired millions of people around the world
            to fight for freedom and justice using peaceful methods.

            Gandhi studied law in London and later worked in South Africa, where he faced racial discrimination. These experiences
            shaped his belief in equality and justice. Upon returning to India, he became a key figure in the struggle for independence.
            Through movements like the Salt March and Quit India Movement, he mobilized people from all walks of life.

            Mahatma Gandhi's dedication, humility, and leadership made him a national hero. He wore simple clothes, lived a simple life,
            and preached harmony among all religions. Unfortunately, he was assassinated on January 30, 1948. Despite his death, his
            legacy of peace and non-violence continues to influence the world today.
